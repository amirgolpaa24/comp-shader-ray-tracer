# My OpenGL Compute Shader Project

This project demonstrates the use of OpenGL compute shaders to render a texture on a fullscreen quad. The compute shader updates a texture with specified colors or patterns, and the texture is then rendered on the screen using vertex and fragment shaders.

## Requirements
- OpenGL 4.5 or later
- CMake 3.10 or later
- GLFW and GLAD libraries

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
